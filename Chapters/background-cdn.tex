\section{CDN}
\label{sec:background-cdn}

The goal of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is to serve content faster and more reliable to end-users through multiple servers in multiple data centers across the world. 
CDNs provide replication of content and smart matching of end-users to appropriate CDN servers, \eg via PaDIS~\cite{POESE10-ICD} or ALTO~\cite{RFC-ALTO} services, which take advantage of this replication. 
Consequently, this means that the vast majority of popular content is available on multiple sources throughout the Internet. 

Taking advantage of replicated content over multiple sources is one main feature of \mhttp.
