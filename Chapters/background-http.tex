\section{HTTP}
\label{sec:background-http}

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless transfer protocol~\cite{RFC-2616} on top of TCP. 
After establishing a connection to a server, a client forms and sends a request and awaits the response from the server. 
Many different meta parameters about the file and the connection itself can be specified inside a request and response header in order for client and server to properly coordinate the file transfer. 

Currently, HTTP is the most used standard to deploy new services and applications~\cite{defacto-http}.
Estimates state, that HTTP is the main protocol with more than $60$\perc of today's traffic in the internet~\cite{MAIER09-ODC}. 
Moreover, studies have shown that large files are of major importance today, since they account for the bulk of the total volume of traffic on the internet~\cite{MAIER08-ENS}. 
\mhttp~is designed for HTTP traffic and specifically aims to greatly decrease the download times of large files, while not harming download times of very small files.

In order to request only parts of a file, \mhttp~takes advantage of HTTP's range request feature~\cite{RFC-7233}. 
Inside the range request the exact range of wanted bytes can be specified, thus allowing the data to be chunked over different requests.
