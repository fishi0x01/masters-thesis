\lhead{Chapter V. \emph{Smart mHTTP}}

Intelligent chunk scheduling is a key feature to maximize the overall throughput that can be achieved with \mhttp, which is why 
one major contribution of this work is the design and implementation of such intelligent chunk scheduling algorithms. 
In this chapter we explain in detail the problems of chunk scheduling in \mhttp~and introduce different approaches on how to solve them. 

\protoold~already provides a simple scheduling algorithm with a fixed chunk size, which we call from now on the \algbase~scheduler. 
We will use this scheduler to have a fair baseline comparison with more advanced scheduling approaches. 
%Besides having a fixed chunk size, the \algbase~scheduler tries to determine possible bottleneck connections by comparing the measured throughputs.
%In case a connection is determined as slow and therefore presents a possible bottleneck, the scheduler estimates how many chunks should be skipped by this connection and left for download for the faster connection in order to avoid too many out-of-order chunks in the buffer.
