\label{sec:vanilla-advantages}

\strong{Completely Client Based} \protoold~only requires small changes to the client's socket API. 
Hence, without making any changes to the server, a client can fetch a file from multiple sources at the same time. 
This makes it ideal for studies on download performance of real world content. 

\strong{Transparent to Application Layer} \protoold~is transparent to the application, \ie no changes to the applications have to be done in order to use \mhttp, since it simply wraps around the socket library, while serving the same API. 

\strong{Taking Advantage of different Network Diversities} Using multiple sources and interfaces, \mhttp~takes advantage of the network diversity over different paths.
