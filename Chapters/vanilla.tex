\lhead{Chapter IV. \emph{mHTTP Vanilla}}

In this chapter we have a brief look at the prototype from previous studies, \protoold. 
The majority of this chapter is already covered by the previous \mhttp~study~\cite{KIM13-MHTTP}, but we have to introduce major components, advantages and potential issues in order to get a deeper understanding of the requirements for the new prototype \protonew.
